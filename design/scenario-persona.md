# Persona
**name:** Hank
**age:** 23
**occupation:** Student at ITVitae
**amount of friends:** Many

## Scenario
Hank hears all about social media platforms from his friends. 
Every one of his friends uses a gazillion different apps to:
- Post all about everything they do and think.
- Follow the posts of their friends and their favorite celebrities.
- Show that they like the posts that they like... By liking the posts...
- Get all the attention other people get by reposting the same things... 

Hank wants in on the fun. But what Hank doesn't want is having to download, create an account and following/befriending everyone he knows on multiple platforms.
That's why Hank is looking for a social media platform that does it all. One that he himself can recommend to his friends. But most importantly: one website that looks better than all the other ones combined.
